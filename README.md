# Computer vision
Computer vision small projects. All the algorithms are programmed from scratch. 

- [(mp1) Image segmentation](https://github.com/Marnonel6/computer_vision/tree/main/machine_problems/mp1)
    * Sequential Connected Component Labeling
    * Size/Noise Filter
- [(mp2) Morphological Operators](https://github.com/Marnonel6/computer_vision/tree/main/machine_problems/mp2)
    * Dilation
    * Erosion
    * Opening
    * Closing
    * Boundary
- [(mp3) Histogram Equalization](https://github.com/Marnonel6/computer_vision/tree/main/machine_problems/mp3)
    * Improve contrast and brightness
- [(mp4) Histogram-based Skin Color Detection](https://github.com/Marnonel6/computer_vision/tree/main/machine_problems/mp4)
    * Training a 2D histogram in HSV color space for Skin Color Detection
